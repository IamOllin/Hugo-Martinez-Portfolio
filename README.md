# HM Alpha Stage Portfolio

This starter profile page is an evolving document that will grow as my skill set adapts to new languages learned in UTSA Full Stack Bootcamp!

(HM stands for Hugo Martinez! ðŸ˜€)

## Usage

Using the profile is a great way to keep up with what my current projects are as they evolve over time, please do peruse and check back from time to time!

## Roadmap

The current roadmap is to add more projects during my stint at UTSA, and improve on this page by adding more responsive elements and helping it grow past this intital alpha stage (which it is). 

## Acknowledgment

This was possible with the help of lessons from class and online resources from w3schools, and MDN Web Docs as well. I will update this portion as it grows forward.
